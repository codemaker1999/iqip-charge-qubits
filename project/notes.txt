General
--------

* fig of CPB

* small sc circuits exhibiting the Josephson effect can be exploited to create qubits

* general idea: base num of cp on island, define states by excess # cp

* By specific fab, we can indeed create conditions in which coherent qubits can be acheived [#] (only cp tunnel)
    ie...
    * sub-femto capacitance
    * specific relationships between energies in the sys (josephson, coupling, charging, ...)

* sys ham is then H=4E_c(n-n_g)^2-E_Jcos\Theta

* various voltage gates employed, coupled in by capacitors
    * gate: control n_g
    * manip done by voltage pulse gates

* for specifics of how CPBs and SQUIDs work and derivations and shit like that, refer to pages pages 359-366 of [reviewPaper]



Fab
----

* Typical fab tech as follows [onePulseGatePhysica]

* Al shadow evap'd

* mask prep'd by ebeam lith and dry etch

* Al + O2 in evap chamber causes oxidation
    * different time and gas pressure used to acheive different junction params for JJs and probe juncs

* circuit op'd in dilute fridge with mixing chamber temp of 40mK



One-Qubit
----------

* Idea
    * attach CPB to SQUID
    * |0>=n CPs, |1>=n+1 CPs
    * superposn coupling from tunneling CPs
    * control evolution coherently with voltage pulse (modify energies of levels)

* Fig 2
    * tuning Qt with the gate voltage we can bring energies to equality
    * however because of josephson coupling there is splitting and we can have coherent superposn state. This is the basis of the qubit.

* evo
    * choose initial Vg s.t. island is in ground state
    * apply sharp voltage pulse to bring system to superposn state nonadiabatically. qb now osc around between ground and excited for pulse duration.

* meas
    * qbs evolve through pulse, pulse ends
    * quasiparts tunnel through probe junction, measd as current
    * probes always connected throughout this evo => must be fairly large resistance to reduce decoherence of qb
    * in this exp, single pulse did not produce measable current, fix with pulse array
    * find current peaks which dont dep on time between pulses (Tr) see fig 2
    * fig 3 shows plot of just the pulse-indeced comp of cur, and its dep on delta t

* results
    * by numerically solving a time dep schro eqn, the second graph in fig 3 was obtained
    * validates experimental results since I \propto <P(excited)>



Two-Qubit
----------

* now that we have blah blah, can start adding qubits. q computers are cool blah blah

* idea: couple CPB to SQUID-controlled box by capacitor to get entangled states

* circuit of one such exp [#] shown in fig 4
    * common pulse gate with approx equal coupling to each box (some experiments use two pulse gates)
    * two dc gates, two probes, two boxes
    * designed st can estimate parameters in circuit diagram (charging energies, josephson energies, ...)

* ham..?

* for such a setup, a countour plot of the ground-state as fun of gate induced charges given in fig 5 [onePulseGatePhysica]
    * dotted lines are degen
    * (0,0) is minima, can assume close to (0,0) => stay at (0,0)
    * X maxima, this is where we get 4 level sys approx
    * This img is from one-pulse-gate exp, so gate causes 45deg shift in charges, indicated by arrows

* electrostatic => at L and R the system will behave as one osc qb with freq $\omega=E_J/\hbar$

* with correctly designed circuit, can achieve energy splitting as seen in fig 6

* To show the coupling, use pulses of differing lengths and meas the osc (use array of pulses as before)

* first meas the qbs at L and R to get E_{J1,J2}, then drive to X and meas in the coupled scenario

* using ham and perfect rectangular pulse can derive prob of being in excited state $...$, ie we have two freqs

* should see two freqs in cur measments => we do => qbs coupled => qbs entangled

* [explain how dual-pulse-gate CNOT works? it's too looonngggg...]

* Yamamoto's group used a two-pulse-gate setup to perform a CNOT gate



Discussion
-----------

* much work done on one, some successes in two, future is bright and shit

* other implems like flux qbs and transmon qbs also likely have interesting  work in future

* potential to scale makes s.s.sys good contender for large q comps
