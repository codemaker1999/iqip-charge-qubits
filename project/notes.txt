General
--------

* fig of CPB

* small sc circuits exhibiting the Josephson effect can be exploited to create qubits

* general idea: base num of cp on island, define states by excess # cp

* By specific fab, we can indeed create conditions in which coherent qubits can be acheived [#] (only cp tunnel)
    ie...
    * sub-femto capacitance
    * specific relationships between energies in the sys (josephson, coupling, charging, ...)

* sys ham is then H=4E_c(n-n_g)^2-E_Jcos\Theta

* various voltage gates employed, coupled in by capacitors
    * gate: control n_g
    * manip done by voltage pulse gates

* for specifics of how CPBs and SQUIDs work and derivations and shit like that, refer to pages pages 359-366 of [reviewPaper]



Fab
----

* Typical fab tech as follows [onePulseGatePhysica]

* Al shadow evap'd

* mask prep'd by ebeam lith and dry etch

* Al + O2 in evap chamber causes oxidation
    * different time and gas pressure used to acheive different junction params for JJs and probe juncs

* circuit op'd in dilute fridge with mixing chamber temp of 40mK



One-Qubit
----------

* Idea
    * attach CPB to SQUID
    * |0>=n CPs, |1>=n+1 CPs
    * superposn coupling from tunneling CPs
    * control evolution coherently with voltage pulse (modify energies of levels)

* Fig 2
    * tuning Qt with the gate voltage we can bring energies to equality
    * however because of josephson coupling there is splitting and we can have coherent superposn state. This is the basis of the qubit.

* evo
    * choose initial Vg s.t. island is in ground state
    * apply sharp voltage pulse to bring system to superposn state nonadiabatically. qb now osc around between ground and excited for pulse duration.

* meas
    * qbs evolve through pulse, pulse ends
    * quasiparts tunnel through probe junction, measd as current
    * probes always connected throughout this evo => must be fairly large resistance to reduce decoherence of qb
    * in this exp, single pulse did not produce measable current, fix with pulse array
    * find current peaks which dont dep on time between pulses (Tr) see fig 2
    * fig 3 shows plot of just the pulse-indeced comp of cur, and its dep on delta t

* results
    * by numerically solving a time dep schro eqn, the second graph in fig 3 was obtained
    * validates experimental results since I \propto <P(excited)>



Two-Qubit
----------

* now that we have blah blah, can start adding qubits. q computers are cool blah blah

* idea: couple CPB to SQUID-controlled box by capacitor to get entangled states

* 



Discussion
-----------

* much work done on one, some successes in two, future is bright and shit

* other implems like flux qbs and transmon qbs also likely have interesting  work in future

* potential to scale makes s.s.sys good contender for large q comps
