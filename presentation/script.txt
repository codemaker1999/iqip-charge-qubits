Theory
-------

* We know the interaction Ham for individual qubits

* If we design the circuit in a specific way, we can be confident that a 4-level system approx is appropriate at point X

* Hamiltonian can then be derived for point X in the 4 level basis

Experiment
-----------

* measurements
    * ...

* apply gate voltage to change n_g. ex: setting n_g=0.5 is an equal superposition of charge states on the island

* pulse non-adiabatically to point of interest on charging diagram. Since pulse gate has ~equal coupling to each qubit, application of this pulse shifts the state of the system along 45 deg line

* apply rectangular pulses
    * control and target qubits 
    * dual frequency beat pattern implies qubits interfereing

* readout
    * apply voltage to probes
    * voltage reduces energy barrier between CPB and probe
    * extra Cooper pair transfers as two quasiparticles => state 1
    * no transmission => state 0

* Coherence (trade-offs, considerations)
    * Measurement probe is more accurate when closer, but causes more decoherence when closer

Fabrication Techniques
-----------------------

* evaporation
    * used to deposite Al onto substrate (shadow evaporation)
    * between evaporation steps, put oxygen in evaporation chamber to oxidize Al. This creates a thin layer of insulation which acts as a convenient tunnel junction

* e-beam lith
    * layer of resist is placed on a substrate
    * e-beam focussed using 25nm balls of gold
    * masks are used to help create certain features
    * e-beam changes solubility of the resist
    * developing stage - immerse in solvent
    * EBL used over photolith because of accuracy (~10nm instead of ~125nm)

* etching
    * used to remove layers from the surface of a substrate
    * wet etching is a chemical bath
    * dry etching is blasting the wafer with ions (plasma of gases)
    * dry is used more often for nanofab because you can get ~100nm features as opposed to ~1um
    * also more costly, harder to do, poor selectivity

* liftoff
    1. prepare substrate
    2. deposite stencil layer
    3. patterning (ex: etching)
    4. deposite target material
    5. "lift-off" of stencil
    * used when poor selectivity of etching is a problem, or when deeper layers would be damaged by etching
    * common problem: lift-off malfunction
