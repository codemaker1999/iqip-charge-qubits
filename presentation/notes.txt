Coupling of Two Qubits
    Basic Idea
        Two Cooper Pair boxes coupled via a capacitor, one of which is controlled with              a squid

    The Circuit
        Composed of 2 Cooper Pair boxes
        Each box is coupled via capacitors to a reservoir, each other, a current probe, and the             common pulse gate
        The DC gates allow us to set the initial states of each qubit directly
        The pulse gate affects both qubits equally

    Charging Diagram of Two Qubit Case
        Diagram 1
            Consider this as a 4 level system, although there are further energy levels, we                 will justify this later.
            These four quadrants represent the possible states of the sytem
            The arrows are from the common pulse gate, since it affects each qubit equally,                 it shifts   the state along a 45 degree line.
            At the state L, the two states of the second qubit are degenerate
            At R, the first qubit has a degeneracy
            At L or R, the system acts has a single qubit oscillating between the |0> and |1>               state
            At X, there is a double degeneracy
            The frequency of the oscillations is    
            Note: this diagram is only valid for small Josephson coupling, except at the                boundaries
        
        Diagram 2
            When the system is driven to the co-resonance point X, the two qubit system                 becomes a coherent superposition of all 4 states. The states will then relax to                 the ground state, and after a certain period of time, they will decay to a lower                state, emitting a quasi particle. This quasi-particle can be measured as a current              in the probes. 
    Points L and R
        The same as the previous diagram, only at points L and R respectively

    Charging Diagram Level Curves
        Because of the large electrostatic energies involved, when  are far from the            boundaries, it is safe to assume that the states will not spontaneously change to           other states.
    Charging Energy Diagram
        This diagram relates the Energy and the Charge digrams, along one slice at L you            have one degeneracy, along a slice at R you have a different degeneracy, and                between the two slices s the co-resonant zone where you have a double               degeneracy.

    Theory
        We approximate the system by a 4 level system, as explained above. This choice is           justified since the fabrication condition   guarantees that the gap to          the higher energy states is sufficiently large as to be ignored.
        The diagonal terms in this Hamiltonian denote the coupling between the two qubits,          while the off diagonal terms denote the coupling between each qubit and its individual          reservoir.
        We have direct control over the diagonal terms by choosing , so we can effectively          control the coupling between the two qubits.
         is the coupling energy between the 2 qubits.

    Theory 2
        Using an initial state, the Hamiltonian, and a rectangular pulse of length dt we can            calculate probability amplitudes, and further calculate the probability of each qubit           being in state 1.
        The main thing to notice here is that the coupled qubits exhibit two oscillatory                frequencies instead of one, this indicates that the two qubits are indeed interacting.
        
    State Readout
        In the readout scheme, the probe current is measured proportionally to the probability          of each qubit having a Cooper pair in it regardless of the state of the other qubit.
        Using the current probes, biased at 600µV, we can get measurements of the Josephson             Energies of the individual qubits. Since at the points L or R, the coupling between the             qubits has almost no effect on the frequency of oscillation, this can be done with very             high accuracy. 
    Parameter Measurements/ Frequency Responses
        By tuning the system to L or R, you can excite oscillations in one of the qubits. By then           applying an array of pulses, you can measure the current after a certain time evolution             has occurred. By doing this for varying length of pulses, you can plot the current as a             function of time. The estimated amplitude of the applied pulses is 30mV
        Since the current oscillates with the qubit, this data can then be used to measure the          oscillations, and thus the Josephson Energies of the individual qubits.
        These cosines decay exponentially, with a decay time of ~2.5 ns.
        As you can see, the spectrum of oscillations is grouped around one value. We identify           these values with .
        We use independent measurement of d.c. current-voltage-gate-voltage characteristics             yields .

        A similar process is used, except at point X, revealing the existence of 2 main oscillatory             frequencies. This fits with theoretical expectation. The dotted lines show the theoretical          expected frequencies.
        The decay time of the coupled system, ~0.6 ns, is shorter compared to the independent           oscillations, which is qualitatively expected due to the extra decoherence channel. 
        The amplitudes of the spectral peaks do not exactly agree with the theoretical              predictions, this is attributed to non ideal pulse shape (rise/fall time ~ 35 ps) and the           fact that a small shift of  off the co-resonance point drastically change the               oscillation pattern.
        Numerical data calculated, taking into account realistic pulse shape and an initial             condition of non pure |00> assuming the system was exactly at the co-resonance,             showed that  gives better agreement with the experimental data.
    EJ1 Dependence of Spectrum Components
        A plot of the oscillation frequencies against a variable , controlled by a weak                 magnetic field (up to 20G)
        Open circles are first qubit, open triangles second qubit
        Without coupling, the single peaks in each qubit follow the dashed lines with an        intersection at .
        After the coupling is introduced, a gap is created, shifting the frequencies to higher and          lower values. The spacing gap is equal to  when .
        
        Because of the double frequency structure of the probability oscillations in both qubits            and the frequency repulsion at , we can conclude that the 2 qubits do indeed            interact.
        This in turn implies that they do become entangled during the course of the coupled             oscillations.
        No direct measurements of the entanglement were performed.

        
A direct measurement of the entanglement was not performed in this experiment. However, analytical calculations were done of the evolution of the entanglement (negativity, concurrence, and entropy of formation) 
The amount of entanglement was calculated using the standard expression for the case of pure states using entropy as a measure of entanglement. 

Using the Hamiltonian the time evolution of the entropy was calculated (Final page of the extended paper) with a rectangular pulse shape. 
E as a function of time for equal Josephson Energies Ej1 = Ej2 = 9.1 GHz
The simulation shows that the entropy has an oscillatory nature, and reaches full entanglement at approx 0.2 ns. 
Further numerical simulations show realistic pulse shape does not significantly decrease entanglement. 


Fabrication Techniques
-----------------------

* evaporation
    * used to deposite Al onto substrate (shadow evaporation)
    * between evaporation steps, put oxygen in evaporation chamber to oxidize Al. This creates a thin layer of insulation which acts as a convenient tunnel junction

* e-beam lith
    * layer of resist is placed on a substrate
    * e-beam focussed using 25nm balls of gold
    * masks are used to help create certain features
    * e-beam changes solubility of the resist
    * developing stage - immerse in solvent
    * EBL used over photolith because of accuracy (~10nm instead of ~125nm)

* etching
    * used to remove layers from the surface of a substrate
    * wet etching is a chemical bath
    * dry etching is blasting the wafer with ions (plasma of gases)
    * dry is used more often for nanofab because you can get ~100nm features as opposed to ~1um
    * also more costly, harder to do, poor selectivity

* liftoff
    1. prepare substrate
    2. deposite stencil layer
    3. patterning (ex: etching)
    4. deposite target material
    5. "lift-off" of stencil
    * used when poor selectivity of etching is a problem, or when deeper layers would be damaged by etching
    * common problem: lift-off malfunction
